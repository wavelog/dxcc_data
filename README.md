# DXCC data fallback for Wavelog

Datasource: Clublog.org

This is the fallback for the DXCC Update within Wavelog. **You don't have to do anything here**. Wavelog handles that by itself and this repo is self-maintaining.

For reference check out `application/controllers/Update.php` the `dxcc()` Method
